- io.py - replace hardcoded names with objects from model.py - can introduce both Input and Output attributes
- create acd tests
- clean up tests folder (files???)
- create setup.py / initialisation of path
- unit tests should be run while building the distribution

Future improvements
- ChargeCalculator should be more versatile: match all +s and -s, and sum them up to get the net charge - or use RDKit built in functions to get net charge GetFormalCharge()
