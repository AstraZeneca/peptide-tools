# Sequences are presented in FASTA format
# the header line starts from '>' folowed by a list of identifiers and measurements (separated by '|') according:
# a) Gauci et al. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200800295
# b) Heller et al. doi: 10.1021/pr050193v (data coming from this study contain also information about UNIPROT identifiers from which peptides come from)
# Each header line ends with "mean exp pI:" which denote mean experimental isoelectric point from the rest of the header
# 
# The line below header line contains protein/peptide sequence in single letter IUPAC code
# 
# This file is cleaned (no sequences with MSA>3 and no duplicates)
